Place sample audio files here. The repository currently references cc0_demo_clip.mp3. Ensure any audio added is properly licensed (CC0 / CC-BY etc.) and document attribution here.
This folder can contain short Creative Commons / CC0 audio excerpts for demo use.

NOTES:
 - Do NOT commit large audio. Keep each clip short (<30s) & low bitrate.
 - Always verify license terms at original source before distributing.
 - Run `npm run fetch:samples` to download example clips & generate `attribution.json`.
 - `attribution.json` should accompany any distribution requiring attribution.
 - If you replace samples, update both the JSON and UI list in `source-separator.component.ts`.

Placeholder file names referenced in code until you fetch real samples:
 - indie_rock_excerpt.mp3
 - female_vocal_guitar_excerpt.mp3
 - funk_groove_cc0.mp3

Remove this note or trim once real curated samples are in place.
