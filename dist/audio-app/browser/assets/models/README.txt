Place quantized ONNX separation models here. Large models (>50MB) may slow initial page load; prefer dynamic/lazy loading and possibly external CDN hosting.

Expected file for current registry entry:
  mdx_demucs_4stem_q.onnx  (quantized 4-stem model producing vocals, drums, bass, other)

NOTES:
- Ensure licensing of the model allows redistribution in this repository.
- Consider providing a checksum (SHA256) for integrity verification.
- You may optionally host the model elsewhere (e.g. GitHub Releases) and update the URL in model-registry.ts instead of bundling it.
